Feature: data object
  In order to manage data objects
  As an admin
  I want to be able to create and maintain data objects

    Background:
      Given the user "John Arbuckle" has permissions "regular user, department administrator"
      And I am "John Arbuckle"
      And I have locations "Cat Aisle, Dog Aisle, Checkout" in location group "Jurassic Park Pets" for the department "Pet Store"
      And I have a data type with name "Cat", description "they're animals", for the department "Pet Store", with the following data fields
        | name              | display_type | values                                   |
        | Name              | text_field   | string                                   |
        | Color             | select_box   | Black, Orange, Yellow, White, Gray       |
        | Interests         | check_box    | Eating, Sleeping, Lasagna, Chasing Jerry |
        | Comments          | text_area    |                                          |
        | Number of lives   | text_field   | integer                                  |
        | Level of cuteness | text_field   | float                                    |
      And I am on the data types page

      And I fill in "Description" with "he hates Mondays"
      And I check "Cats Aisle"
      And I check "Checkout"
      And I press "Create"
      Then I should have 1 data_object
      And I should see "New cat created"
