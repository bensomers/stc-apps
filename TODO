Four Tables:
  Data Types      Name, Description
  Data Objects    Name, type_id
  Data Fields     Name, data_type (i.e. int, select_box, float, etc )
  Data Items      obj_id, fields(comma separated list of field ids), data (comma separated list of corresponding data objects)
  (& join table for types to fields)
  
Refactor User / User admin code
  Create controllers for Roles, permissions, groups, and departments
  Consider refactoring permission structure to only user groups and roles (instead of groups, roles, and permissions)

  Cucumber - Integration tests
  Shoulda + Mocha - Mocks and stubs - Probably don't need shoulda.
