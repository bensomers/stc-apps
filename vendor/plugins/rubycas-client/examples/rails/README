This is a skeleton Rails application hooked up for CAS authentication.

To try this out:

1. If you have an existing CAS server, modify the CAS client settings in 
   config/environment.rb to point to your server. If you do not yet 
   have a CAS server, install rubycas-server, and configure it to run on
   http://localhost:7777 (or modify environment.rb to your likings).

2. Run `ruby script/server`

3. Point your web browser to http://localhost:3000

4. Have a look at the source code in app/controllers/simple_example_controller.rb
   and app/controllers/advanced_example_controller.rb. The 
   corresponding views under app/views might also be worth looking at.
