h1. Very flat merb app with casclient support

Run rubycas-server or other CAS server on localhost:7777

Then type this:
<pre><code>
merb -I merb_auth_cas.rb
</code></pre>

Then point your web browser to http://localhost:4000.
You should be redirected to the CAS login screen, then
to your Merb application showing your username.
